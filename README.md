# Seagull

Seagull is a library to make it easy to integrate html-over-the-wire frameworks and
use them with the Go http server.

Goals:
- Simple to use like the http handlers
- Router agnostic
- Javascript Library agnostic
- Templating method agnostic
- Offer best-practice examples to help with easy setup
